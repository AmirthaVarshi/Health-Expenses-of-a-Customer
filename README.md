#Machine Learning Project

The "Health-Expenses-of-a-Customer" project in machine learning could involve developing a model to predict an individual's health expenses based on various factors such as age, gender, pre-existing medical conditions. 
The objective of the project is to analyze the data and understand the factors that drive health expenses, and then build a machine learning model to make predictions.
